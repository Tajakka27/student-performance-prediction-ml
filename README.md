# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

This machine learning project analyzes student lifestyle, habits, and health factors to predict their academic performance. The goal is to identify the key factors that impact students' exam scores, providing insights that could help in academic performance prediction and improvement.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- **Understand which factors impact student exam scores**: Analyze various student lifestyle, habits, and health data to find patterns.
- **Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and visualize the dataset to uncover relationships and trends.
- **Train regression models**: Build machine learning models to predict student exam scores based on the features.

## 🔍 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique used to analyze datasets to summarize their key characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA helps in detecting patterns, identifying outliers, and formulating hypotheses about the data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 File Structure
- `student_habits_performance.csv`: Dataset containing various factors affecting student performance.
- `student_performance_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that contains the implementation for the EDA and machine learning model training.
